Refunds can be processed on the Stripe Application - To be tested
We can implement refunds on the app but that could be a future feature / Release 
For now i think we could have it that the User can see previous Camps / Events within the last X days 
and then request a refund then the business would log in and see the nofication and go on the Stripe application and process
how do we tell the outcome - Notifications ?

APPLE PAY SETUP - SO THIS WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO ACCESSed when we get a merchantID , We will first do card only as this is main form and also Dev Program is £99 and i was having issues getting this setup we will fix this in the future 

Merchant ID 
If your app is being built for a specific client and they will take over the app once it's live, you have a couple of options regarding the Apple Merchant ID:

You Keep Ownership, But Integrate with Their Stripe Account: If you continue to own and maintain the app on behalf of the client, you can keep your Apple Merchant ID and integrate with the client's Stripe account. In this scenario, the client provides you with their Stripe publishable key and other necessary credentials, and you update the Stripe configuration in your app accordingly.
Client Assumes Full Ownership: If the client will assume full ownership of the app, including the Apple Developer account and any related credentials, they will need to create their own Apple Merchant ID and integrate with their own Stripe account. Once they have their own credentials, they will need to update the Stripe configuration in the app before taking it live.
The approach you choose depends on the agreement with your client and how ownership and maintenance of the app are being structured. It's essential to clarify this with your client and determine the best course of action before deploying the app live.


publishableKey: This is your Stripe publishable key, which you get from your Stripe Dashboard. It's used to identify your account with Stripe and authenticate API requests from your app. This is required for integrating with Stripe.
merchantIdentifier: This is an identifier provided by Apple when you set up Apple Pay in your Stripe account. It's used to configure Apple Pay for your app. If you're not setting up Apple Pay, you can omit this property or set it to undefined.
urlScheme: This is a custom URL scheme for your app, which is used for deep linking and handling redirects. You can set this to a unique value for your app (e.g., your-app-name://), but it's optional unless you're setting up Apple Pay.
