Working on - 3 BUGS 
Bug 1 - Console Error on Dates DDL - this may resolve BUG2 aswell , also on Edit participant
Bug 3 - Edit Participant list is incorrect , it has users bookings that are not linked to that booking , i think we need if the user clicks out of the Create a booking then it clears the previous enter data which
BUG 2 - Booking a Camp , once payment is successful it is not sending the user back to the Dashboard
Bug 4 - Make selecting a Participant a required field , must select at least 1 participant
REMAP Refund process 



// MyBookings Frontend . needd to fix , step by step add the code in to understand and add comments
// onpress on View container if a button is TouchableOpacity and a view contaimner





--------


Images  on Home
FRONT END - if there is no discount it just has % so we need it to not appear or 0%

Need a redirect if the user cancels Process of payment so doest enter details

Things to tidy up , replace all buttons so that onPress is on the TouchableOpacity not the text + remove console.logs

ANDROID FULL TEST - Date TIME picker and dropdown CHecks , some componets might not work .

Terms and conditions  - ON SIGN UP SCREEN

DESIGN WORK - need to create a list

TASKS TO DO
Stripe API key needs to be in ENV



Notifications
IF USER has booked >= 2 CAMPS THEN -> 
USER is eligible for Jumper -> Notify Admin / highlight person on attendance

is there a way to create custom bar , Notification Bar?  


------------
Notifications - PUSHING THIS BACK TO THE END as needs ios Dev program(PAID)




// CHEAT MODE -  WITH OFFERS - NEED to DISCUSS THIS 
IF user books 4 camps and then books one camp as its now 50 % off 
and then decides ok ill request Refund the other 4- I think its up to ADmin to 
spot this but the odds of this happening 

------------

NOTES of things todo / research 

 CRM Book / PaymentStripe
 -- GO live CheckList - Research 

--------
FUTURE DEV WORK
 Calander - FUTURE development
Edit a Offer is not possible yet - FUTURE development





Dropdown option - Choose a person then we delete that record as with the above option we cant determine which particpants record. 

Full refund Button -> Send a Notification Record to the ADMIN -> ADMIN Then logs in and can see the requests and 
then they must go onto Stripe to refund.

Make BOOKING   / Checkout questions  - (CRM ONLY)
Has your child have any disablities or alergies ** State 
we do not store allegies / disablities only until the event / camp is over.
      //Update Array with record  - We will not be updating the DB until after the payment?? 

-----

Manage bookings (ADMIN ONLY)

Edit Camp / Event - Need to maintain Time and date and price all values and the user has the option to edit whatever so i think we will be PUT all 
Delete Camp / Event - DONE

------


Add to BASKET and return back later or just have it for now just have to reenter?



Logout Button



------
Admin View  -- 

This where they will be able to add / Delete upcoming events and add Payment links with Stripe
Create event
Create a Camp  
Manage bookings 

Test needed on Andriod to confirm that all modules work on Andriod/ ios / web - mainly the date picker
Andriod date time not sure if working or coded right , will need to test
Handlesubmit within createcamp is only tested in ios unsure about Andriod yet 
------



put MongoDB URL in .env file 






Knowledge of the app / Workings 

Stripe
NEED TO PUT KEYS IN ENV file , cant get it working at the min


Refunds can be processed on the Stripe Application - To be tested
We can implement refunds on the app but that could be a future feature / Release 
For now i think we could have it that the User can see previous Camps / Events within the last X days 
and then request a refund then the business would log in and see the nofication and go on the Stripe application and process
how do we tell the outcome - Notifications ?  


refunds


APPLE PAY SETUP - SO THIS WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO ACCESSed when we get a merchantID , We will first do card only as this is main form and also Dev Program is £99 and i was having issues getting this setup we will fix this in the future 

Merchant ID 
If your app is being built for a specific client and they will take over the app once it's live, you have a couple of options regarding the Apple Merchant ID:

You Keep Ownership, But Integrate with Their Stripe Account: If you continue to own and maintain the app on behalf of the client, you can keep your Apple Merchant ID and integrate with the client's Stripe account. In this scenario, the client provides you with their Stripe publishable key and other necessary credentials, and you update the Stripe configuration in your app accordingly.
Client Assumes Full Ownership: If the client will assume full ownership of the app, including the Apple Developer account and any related credentials, they will need to create their own Apple Merchant ID and integrate with their own Stripe account. Once they have their own credentials, they will need to update the Stripe configuration in the app before taking it live.
The approach you choose depends on the agreement with your client and how ownership and maintenance of the app are being structured. It's essential to clarify this with your client and determine the best course of action before deploying the app live.


publishableKey: This is your Stripe publishable key, which you get from your Stripe Dashboard. It's used to identify your account with Stripe and authenticate API requests from your app. This is required for integrating with Stripe.
merchantIdentifier: This is an identifier provided by Apple when you set up Apple Pay in your Stripe account. It's used to configure Apple Pay for your app. If you're not setting up Apple Pay, you can omit this property or set it to undefined.
urlScheme: This is a custom URL scheme for your app, which is used for deep linking and handling redirects. You can set this to a unique value for your app (e.g., your-app-name://), but it's optional unless you're setting up Apple Pay.
